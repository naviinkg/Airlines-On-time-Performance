# Airlines On-time Performance

This project analyzes the 2019 airline on-time performance data for flights originating from or departing to Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), and California (CA). The key findings are:

* The dataset contains over 1.8 million flight records with information such as flight dates, carrier codes, flight numbers, origin and destination airports, departure and arrival times, delays, elapsed times, and distances.Exploratory data analysis reveals patterns such as monthly variations in the number of flights, top airlines by number of flights, and popular origin and destination airports for the three states.
* The analysis of flight delays shows that some airlines, such as UA, DL, and OO, exhibit higher average departure and arrival delays compared to other top airlines like WN and DL.
* The top 10 airlines by on-time performance percentage are identified, and their monthly total flight hours are analyzed to understand seasonal patterns.
* Three specific aircraft are selected, and their travel routes and average delays at different airports are investigated to uncover potential operational issues or patterns.

Overall, the project provides valuable insights into the airline industry's on-time performance, which could be used to identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall passenger experience.
