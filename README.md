# Airlines On-time Performance
## Project Description:
This project aims to analyze the 2019 airline on-time performance data for flights originating from or departing to Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), and California (CA). The key objectives of this project are:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values and converting data types to appropriate formats.
* Calculating and adding new features, such as elapsed time in hours.


## Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Visualizing the number of flights per month, by carrier code, and by origin/destination airports.
* Analyzing the air traffic patterns for the AZ, NV, and CA regions.
* Identifying the top destination airports for each state.


## Airline Performance Analysis:

* Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) for departure and arrival delays for each airline and airport.
* Identifying airlines that are more prone to delays and analyzing the patterns.
* Determining the airlines with the best on-time performance records.
* Analyzing the total flight hours per month for the top 10 airlines.


## Aircraft-specific Analysis:

* Selecting three aircraft and analyzing their most frequent travel routes.
* Calculating the average arrival and departure delays at the airports for each aircraft.
* Identifying patterns and insights based on the aircraft-specific analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the airline industry's on-time performance, including the identification of factors influencing flight delays, the comparison of carrier performance, and the analysis of aircraft-specific patterns. The findings can be used to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experience, and support decision-making processes in the aviation industry.
